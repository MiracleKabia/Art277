                <h1>Travelling in depression</h1>
                <p> When I was very  little, I caught the travel bug. It started after my grandparents first brought me to their home in france and I have now been to twenty-nine different countries. Each has given me unique learning experience.</p>
                <p>At five I marveled at the Eiffel Tower in the city of Lights. When I was eight, I stood in the herat of piazza sa marco feeding hordes of pigeon, then gilded down Venetian waterways on sleek gonodolas. At thirteen, I saw the ancient, megalithic structure of stonehenge <img src="img/girl.jpg" height="250px" width="300px" alt="girl picture" style="float: left;"/> and walked along the great wall of china. amazed that the thousand-years-old were still in place.</p>
                <p> It was through exploring culture around the world that I first became interested in language</p>
                <p> it began with French, which me taught the importance of pronunciation. I remember once asking a store owner in paris where Rue des Pyramides was. But When I pronounced it PYR-a-mides instead of pyr-A-mides, with more accent on the A, she looked at me bewildered.</p>
                <P> in the eight grade, I became fascinated with spanish and awre of its similarities with EWnglish through congnates. Baseball in Spanish, for example, is beisbol, which looks different but sounds nearly same. The was incredible to me it made speech and comprehension more fluid, and even today I find that congnates come to the rescue when I forget how to say something in Spanish.</P>
                <P>Then in high school, I develop an enthusiasm for chinese. As I studied Chinese at my School, I marveled how if just one stroke was missing from character, the meaning is lost. I loved how woed were formed by combining simpler character, so Huo meaning fire and shan meaning mountain can join to create huoshan which means volcano. I love spending hours at the time practicing the character and I can feel the beauty and rhythm as I form them</P>
